# Cafecito
Knowledge of programming is becoming increasingly important in our society, however almost all widely used programming languages require an understanding of English. When learning how to code, language should not be a barrier. If we truly wish for a more diverse tech community with a more inclusive environment, programming languages should reflect this. With the Cafecito plugin, users can write Java in any language they choose. A text editor of the user's choice will translate keywords in their native language to English so that they can be a part of the growing hacker community despite their lack of fluency in English.

**Entonces, si quieres programmar en español, _puedes_.**

**Se você deseja programar em portugues, _você pode_.**

Best of all, Cafecito is _open source_. We don't know all the languages in the world and we don't pretend to. Users are encouraged to improve existing translations as well as to add languages that are currently unsupported. It takes a team to code something useful, and it takes a world to make it amazing.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
You will need to install your preferred text editor.
<br>*Cafecito is optimized for Atom and VS Code*</br>
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) - Github's open source text editor.
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Microsoft's streamlined code editor.


## Examples

`if` statements:

English:
```
if(Object == true)
{
  System.out.print("Litty");
}
```
Spanish:
```
si(Objeto == verdad)
{
