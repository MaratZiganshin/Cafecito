# Cafecito
When learning programming languages, language should not be a barrier. In order for programming to become more inclusive, the first problem often overlooked is human language. With the Cafecito plugin, you can have your text editor interpret input keywords in your native language.

**Entonces, si quieres programmar en español, _puedes_. **

**Se você deseja programar em portugues, _você pode_. **

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
